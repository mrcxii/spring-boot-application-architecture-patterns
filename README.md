## ⚡ Quick Features Overview

- **Clean Architecture**: Separates the code into layers, making it easier to manage.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Focuses on the core domain and its logic to guide development.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Encourages decoupling of the core logic from external systems.
- **Layered Architecture**: Organizes code into different layers, improving clarity and control.
- **Modular Monolith**: Enables building large systems while still using a single deployment unit.

## 💡 Tips for Use

- Explore the different patterns by modifying them as per your project's needs.
- Use the examples as a learning tool. Understanding these design patterns can significantly improve your coding skills.
